## Asynchronous Code Review

### What is sync and async, how does the event loop work

### Functions as arguments

### Nested callbacks, callback hell.

### Node.js Standard, Error First Callbacks

### Sync vs Async, make the return consistent. (process.nextTick(), setTimeout(,0))

### Promises, basic concept and implementation comparison.

### Promise example and promise API in depth.

### Functions that allow both callbacks and promises

### util.promisify

### Async/await



### Core topics to hit:

* NodeJS allows both synchronous and asynchronous programming. Asynchronous functions return callbacks while synchronous ones return values.

* Callbacks, Promises, and Async/Await are all valid ways to handle async code. Callbacks (especially error-first) are Node.js convention. Promises and Async/Await are recent developments to the scene.

* Node and Chrome use Google's V8 engine, but other engines exist that may or may not support the new functionality.

* The JavaScript try / catch mechanism cannot be used to intercept errors generated by asynchronous APIs. A common mistake for beginners is to try to use throw inside a Node.js style callback:
https://nodejs.org/dist/latest/docs/api/errors.html#errors_node_js_error_codes 

* A function should ALWAYS be either sync or async. Do not give it the option to run both. 

* When creating Async API’s in Node, many developers will assume you’re using the node.js standard, which is a callback based system. Now we have promises. But for the sake of compatibility, you can return both the promise resolve/reject AND the callback call to allow your program to work with either system. Just remember to provide a default value in case no callback is provided. Example at = https://github.com/jscomplete/advanced-nodejs/blob/master/3.1/async-promise.js

* Also worth noting, a promise resolves to a single value asynchronously. An observable can resolve or emit multiple values asynchronously over time.
