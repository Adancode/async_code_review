## Asynchronous Code Review Lesson Plan

### Introduction:

This document serves as a quick reference of resources and code examples for an online review session I'm hosting on 10/30/2017 covering the use of Asynchronous Javascript. Also provides a template lesson plan in case any future intrsuctors wish to re-use this material.

Topics below should be followed in order.

### 01. What is sync and async? How does the event loop work?

* Ask students, "What is synchronous? What is asynchronous? What is the difference, and how do we tell them apart?" Wait a minute or two and have them share their responses.

* "Alright then, how does the event loop work? And how does this effect our code?" Give students another minute or two. Expect that very few students will have an answer for this one.

* Show students the diagram located here = https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31582672/what-is-the-different-between-javascript-event-loop-and-node-js-event-loop?noredirect=1&lq=1

* And if they haven't seen Phil Roberts Explanation yet, send them this video = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGhZQkoFbQ  

* Let's talk about the callstack and event queue! Open 01_callstack.js

* You should know, the event loop in Node.js has a few minor differences than the event loop in Google Chrome. Node.js also has a slightly larger API for handling and dealing with event timing. (We'll dive into this a little later)

### Functions as arguments

### Nested callbacks, callback hell.

### Node.js Standard, Error First Callbacks

### Sync vs Async, make the return consistent. (process.nextTick(), setTimeout(,0))

### Promises, basic concept and implementation comparison.

### Promise example and promise API in depth.

### Functions that allow both callbacks and promises

### util.promisify

### Async/await



### Core topics to hit:

* NodeJS allows both synchronous and asynchronous programming. Asynchronous functions return callbacks while synchronous ones return values.

* Callbacks, Promises, and Async/Await are all valid ways to handle async code. Callbacks (especially error-first) are Node.js convention. Promises and Async/Await are recent developments to the scene.

* Node and Chrome use Google's V8 engine, but other engines exist that may or may not support the new functionality.

* The JavaScript try / catch mechanism cannot be used to intercept errors generated by asynchronous APIs. A common mistake for beginners is to try to use throw inside a Node.js style callback:
https://nodejs.org/dist/latest/docs/api/errors.html#errors_node_js_error_codes 

* A function should ALWAYS be either sync or async. Do not give it the option to run both. 

* When creating Async API’s in Node, many developers will assume you’re using the node.js standard, which is a callback based system. Now we have promises. But for the sake of compatibility, you can return both the promise resolve/reject AND the callback call to allow your program to work with either system. Just remember to provide a default value in case no callback is provided. Example at = https://github.com/jscomplete/advanced-nodejs/blob/master/3.1/async-promise.js

* Also worth noting, a promise resolves to a single value asynchronously. An observable can resolve or emit multiple values asynchronously over time.
